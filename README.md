Variance-in-Weather-in-R

Youâ€™re planning a trip to London and want to get a sense of the best time of the year to visit. Luckily, you got your hands on a dataset from 2015 that contains over 39,000 data points about weather conditions in London. Surely, with this much information, you can discover something useful about when to make your trip!

By looking at the mean and standard deviation of the temperature in London during each month of the year, we can get a sense of the best time to visit.

Looking at the spread of the data is an important statistic to consider if you are particularly sensitive to extreme days. For example, if you pick a month with a large standard deviation, you might have one day that is relatively cold while the following day is very hot.
